This is a simple feed-processing framework, written in Python.

Processors are classes, which inherent the FeedProc class. The processor uses specifically named functions to determine which item to modify. For example, proc_enteries_title will process each feed item's "title".

Each function is given two arguments, the first is the original value, the second is the entire element (with entries, this is the entire news <item>).
Each function simply returns the desired new value.

As a simple example processor, to truncate every RSS items title to 20 characters:

class ExampleProcessor(FeedProc):
    proc_enteries_title(self, orig_title, full_item):
        truncated_title = orig_title[20:]
        return truncated_title

The whole system is quite simple. It is intended to remove annoyances from RSS feeds, such as adverts, similar to what "Yahoo Pipes" is, but FeedProc is *much* simpler, does not depend on third-party servers proxying, and is much more flexible (it is Python, you can call anything you with form the processor)
